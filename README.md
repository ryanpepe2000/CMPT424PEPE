##2019 Browser-Based Operating System in TypeScript

Note: I attempted to fix the compile issue where 'sh c' was not compiling properly on other machines, but I was unable to test anything because compiling is working just fine on my local machine. Let me know if you are having any issues

This repository contains the code for a browser-based operator system simulator. Each project will be committed under a branch dedicated to the project name (ex: **iProject1**). Additionally, upon completion of each project section, the respective branch will be merged with master.

####Introduction####
Typescript is a powerful programming language which allows for dynamic generation of javascript. This language provides a plethora of benefits including the displaying of compile-time errors in conjunction to the standard javascript runtime errors. As a result, typescript has a greater potential for debugging and troubleshooting. The CLI of this OS simulator will be generated as an HTML5 Canvas object and all text will be displayed as drawings on this canvas. 

####Prerequisites####
Before you continue, ensure that you have satisfied the following prerequisites:

* Typescript compiler must be installed.
