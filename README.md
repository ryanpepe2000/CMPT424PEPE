####Introduction####
Typescript is a powerful programming language which allows for dynamic generation of javascript. This language provides a plethora of benefits including the displaying of compile-time errors in conjunction to the standard javascript runtime errors. As a result, typescript has a greater potential for debugging and troubleshooting. The CLI of this OS simulator will be generated as an HTML5 Canvas object and all text will be displayed as drawings on this canvas. 

####Prerequisites####
